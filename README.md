# Arbitrage_Web_App
This is a full stack web app used for calculating and finding arbitrage sports betting opportunities. 
More information on it is in help.html within the templates folder. It uses Flask and Google cloud sql,
with a mySQL web database. 
## Struggles 
I am still working on deploying it using Google App Engine, mainly struggling with the use of Cloud SQL Auth Proxy,
but am continuing to work on this project and specifically deployment.
